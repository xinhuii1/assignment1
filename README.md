Design idea 

Project: 

Build a website for my own fictional company (Library Co.)  

 

External user’s goal: 

Users should be able to easily understand the broad range of services that Library Co. offers. These include digital library access, where users can explore a vast selection of e-books, articles, and other resources; a platform for publishing and creating books at no additional cost, allowing aspiring writers to bring their work to life using our app; as well as options for reading and purchasing the books they're looking for. Library Co. provides everything users need, making it a one-stop destination for all things related to reading, writing, and publishing. The goal is to offer users seamless experience with easy navigation, enabling them to quickly find and access books, novels, articles, and more—all in one place, with the convenience and accessibility they expect. 

 

Site owner’s goal: 

The primary goal for Library Co. is to create a platform that fosters engagement, growth, and long-term success. This involves increasing user engagement and retention by ensuring users regularly return to the platform and spend more time exploring its vast range of resources. Another key objective is to grow the customer base by attracting new users and converting them into loyal customers through clear, valuable offerings such as free access to digital content, self-publishing tools, and exclusive member benefits. In addition, driving sales and generating profit is essential, achieved through the sale of physical and digital books, as well as premium services and subscription-based offerings. Lastly, Library Co. is dedicated to supporting self-publishing and content creation, providing aspiring writers with the tools they need to bring their works to life, while fostering a safe and supportive community for all users. 

 

Features to implement on the website: 

  

Offline book feature (bookmark page):  

While many apps require users to subscribe to premium services for offline access to books, Library Co. offers this feature completely free of charge. Users can download books for offline reading as often as they like, without any restrictions. This allows them to enjoy reading anytime and anywhere, even without an internet connection. Library Co.'s motto, "where magic takes place," reflects its commitment to creating an immersive reading experience. This feature transforms the app into an affordable alternative to platforms like Kindle, ensuring accessibility for all users who seek a seamless and enjoyable reading experience. Users can browse an extensive catalog of eBooks, audiobooks, journals, articles, and more, all available at their fingertips.

This website caters not only to book readers but also to writers who aspire to publish their own works but may not know where to begin. Library Co. provides comprehensive support, including guidance and tutorials for new writers, ensuring they feel confident and informed throughout the publishing process.

The Best-Selling Books feature keeps users engaged with the most popular, trendy, and highly rated books on the platform.

This feature enables users to discover the latest trends and explore books that have captured the attention of readers.

Idea of design: 

Library Co. prioritizes simplicity and convenience through seamless technology and online integration. It offers readers the ability to create a personalized book experience, with offline access to provide an immersive reading journey. Designed with a minimalist and modern aesthetic, the platform fits perfectly into the digital age, enhancing the traditional library experience with innovative features and user-centric design. 

In terms of design, I chose a colour palette that reflects a minimalist style, emphasizing soft beige, white, and brown tones. These colours not only align with the aesthetic of a library, often associated with the warmth of wood and leather-bound books, but also create a calm and distraction-free environment for users. The neutral tones serve to minimize visual clutter, allowing users to focus on the content without being overwhelmed by excessive colour or design elements. 

The typography choice is equally important to ensure a smooth reading experience. Since the platform revolves around reading, I opted for serif fonts, which are known for their readability and classic appeal. Bold font weights are used to highlight important elements such as headings and navigation, while regular weight fonts are applied to body text, making it easier for users to read comfortably. This balance ensures both aesthetic beauty and functionality. 

For the interactive elements, such as buttons, I used rounded corners to create a more approachable and modern feel. Subtle shadow effects around buttons help them stand out, making them more noticeable against the white and brown backgrounds, improving visibility and user engagement. 

Overall, the design focuses on creating a peaceful and immersive environment where users can easily navigate and enjoy reading, while maintaining a visually appealing and modern aesthetic.
